# CSC131Project : MedApp
Medical App for CSC131 Sac state

I was in charge of the authentication and backend user management for this project. We used Google Firebase for the project, and I embedded it into the Swift code and SwiftUI content views. The SignIn folder contains my work.

TO RUN:

Clone the repo in XCode, download the required Firebase packages, and run from IDE. (App is not deployed)
